# Testing Architecture

global symbol CP( "sdfsdf")
codepath switch, saying that a case was reached or not reached
and end of test should reveal out of the universe of codepaths what was hit. 

each run should increment a runcount
generate a unique name for that invocation
and compare what it got this time to last time


for this to work, all prints must become debugs
and the debug flags must be promoted to top level things
probably long time we did this anyway
a --test-harness mode 
	makes debug statements go to STDERR
	should dump out run variables at the end

make sure ls never forces a rehash
make sure that when decending and getting stats, ls finds changed file sizes that lead to revoked hashes
snapshot something
make sure we can ls the thing
make sure snapshot does or does not invalidate other things when its being built
