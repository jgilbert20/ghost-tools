The basic object is a ghost. A ghost is a description of some object discovered "for real" in the filesystem somewhere. 

Things we track for ghosts:

FULLHASH - SHA of the bytestream (aka ghosthash)
FASTHAD - fast SHA of bytestream (empty if not present)
LASTMOD - last modified date from FS
DT_FULLHASH - last full verify
DT_FASTHASH - last fast verify
DT_DISC_OLD - oldest date of discovery
DT_DISC_NEW - newest date of discovery
LFN - one or more pathnames for ghosthash


my $ghost = makeOrFindGhost( LFN );

$GHOST->[FULLHASH];

writeGhostDescriptor( path, GHOST );

A .ghostdesc file is a list of the above entities of information.

The ghosttree is an abstraction around a collection of ghosts
there can be different implementations
the most basic one is just a hashing container that is as lazy as possible

$GhostTree = getAllGhostsUnderPath();

my @ghosts = GhostTree->ghostsForHash();
